When you load a large CSV file into an RDD in Spark, the data is partitioned and distributed across the nodes in the cluster. Each node only loads and processes a portion of the data at a time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the data being processed by a node exceeds the available memory, Spark can automatically spill data to disk to free up memory. This allows Spark to continue processing the data without running out of memory. Once the data on disk is needed again, it can be read back into memory for further processing.</p>\n<p>This approach allows Spark to handle datasets that are larger than the available memory by intelligently managing the use of memory and disk storage.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \n                             width: 100%;\n                             height: 300px; \n                             overflow: hidden;\n                             display: flex;\n                             justify-content: center;\n                             align-items: center;\n                             margin-top: 16px; \n                             margin-bottom: 16px;\n                             \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/507e6/5.webp 200w,\n/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/28a80/5.webp 400w,\n/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/8d2ea/5.webp 800w,\n/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/53334/5.webp 1024w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/36ca5/5.png 200w,\n/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/a3397/5.png 400w,\n/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/a331c/5.png 800w,\n/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/658fc/5.png 1024w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/a331c/5.png\"\n            alt=\"An example image\"\n            title=\"kutta chutiya\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<hr>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>When you say “Spark makes a context,” I believe you are referring to the SparkContext object. The SparkContext is the entry point to any interaction with the Spark cluster and represents the connection to the computing cluster. It is used to create RDDs, accumulators, and broadcast variables on the cluster.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The SparkContext is created by the driver program and is responsible for coordinating the execution of tasks across the cluster. It is responsible for scheduling tasks on the executors and managing data stored in memory or on disk.</p>\n<p>In summary, the SparkContext provides a context for interacting with the Spark cluster and managing distributed data processing.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Sure! Let me give you another example to help you understand better. Let’s say you have a dataset with 1000 rows and 3 columns: Age, Gender, and Income. You want to build a decision tree model to predict if a person will buy a certain product or not based on their age, gender, and income.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, when building the decision tree, at each node, the algorithm needs to decide which feature to use to split the data. Instead of always choosing the best feature (the one that results in the highest information gain), the algorithm can introduce some randomness by randomly selecting a feature to split on. This way, the tree will be different every time you run the algorithm.</p>\n<p>This randomness can help prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and less sensitive to small changes in the data. Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too well, including the noise and random fluctuations in the data. As a result, the model may perform poorly on new, unseen data.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>One way that random numbers are used in the DecisionTreeClassifier algorithm is in selecting the features to split on at each node of the tree. Rather than considering all features, the algorithm selects a random subset of features to consider for each split. This helps to prevent the model from focusing too much on a particular subset of features and encourages it to consider all features when making decisions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another way that random numbers are used is in selecting the samples to include in each node of the tree. Instead of using all available samples, the algorithm selects a random subset of samples to use at each node. This helps to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data by introducing randomness into the process of selecting samples for each node.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Randomness is introduced in DecisionTreeClassifier to make the model more robust and prevent overfitting. The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement1.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, let’s say you have a dataset with 10 features and you are building a decision tree model. At each node of the tree, instead of considering all 10 features to find the best split, the algorithm can randomly select a subset of features (say 3 out of 10) and find the best split using only those 3 features. This introduces randomness in the model and makes it more robust.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>bc = BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=dt, n_estimators=300, n_jobs=-1).wha t is n_estimators. explain me with example</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ans. n_estimators is a parameter in BaggingClassifier that specifies the number of base estimators in the ensemble1. In other words, it determines how many individual models will be trained on random subsets of the original dataset and then combined to form a final prediction.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say you have a dataset with 1000 rows and you want to build a BaggingClassifier model with n_estimators=10. The algorithm will first create 10 random subsets of the original dataset by sampling with replacement. Then, it will train 10 individual models (specified by the base_estimator parameter), one on each subset. Finally, it will combine the predictions of all 10 models to make a final prediction.</p>\n<p>Increasing the value of n_estimators can improve the performance of the model by reducing variance and overfitting. However, it also increases the computational cost as more models need to be trained.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Bagging and Random Forests are both ensemble methods that use multiple models to make predictions. The main difference between them is how they select features when building individual models.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bagging stands for Bootstrap Aggregating. It is an ensemble method that fits multiple base models (e.g., decision trees) on random subsets of the original dataset and then combines their predictions by voting or averaging. Each base model is trained on a different bootstrap sample of the original dataset, which is obtained by sampling with replacement.</p>\n<p>Random Forests, on the other hand, is an extension of bagging that introduces additional randomness when building individual models. In addition to sampling with replacement to create bootstrap samples, Random Forests also randomly selects a subset of features to consider when splitting each node of the decision tree. This is known as feature bagging.</p>\n<p>Here’s a numerical example to help you understand better. Let’s say you have a dataset with 1000 rows and 10 columns and you want to build a Bagging model with n_estimators=10. The algorithm will first create 10 bootstrap samples of the original dataset by sampling with replacement. Then, it will train 10 individual decision trees, one on each bootstrap sample. Finally, it will combine the predictions of all 10 trees to make a final prediction.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s say you want to build a Random Forest model with n_estimators=10 and max_features=3. The algorithm will first create 10 bootstrap samples of the original dataset by sampling with replacement. Then, it will train 10 individual decision trees, one on each bootstrap sample. However, when building each tree, at each node, instead of considering all 10 features to find</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Yes, that’s correct! In AdaBoost, at each iteration, all data points from the original dataset are used to fit the next weak classifier, including the data points that were correctly classified by the previous classifier. However, the weights of the data points are updated at each iteration to increase the weights of misclassified data points and decrease the weights of correctly classified data points. This way, the next model in the sequence focuses more on the misclassified data points.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"aws","author":"Author Name","time":"25/04/2017","summary":"This is a summary of the blog post...abc def gfhy iiii olol olkmn lokjmm kijuyhgtr nhbngvfdc ","article":"Free","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/ed3fb/5.png","srcSet":"/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/573c0/5.png 200w,\n/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/c8dce/5.png 400w,\n/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/ed3fb/5.png 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/f201f/5.webp 200w,\n/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/e8709/5.webp 400w,\n/gatsby8/static/acd1c7db037f46de5d225f0ebc19f58a/e7773/5.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":400}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/economics/scala/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
