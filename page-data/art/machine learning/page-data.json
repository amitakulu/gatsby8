This means that the model is indirectly learning from the test set because its parameters are being adjusted based on how well it performs on the test set. This can lead to overfitting because the model may end up fitting too closely to the patterns in the test set and may not generalize well to new data.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \n                             width: 100%;\n                             height: 300px; \n                             overflow: hidden;\n                             display: flex;\n                             justify-content: center;\n                             align-items: center;\n                             margin-top: 16px; \n                             margin-bottom: 16px;\n                             \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 133.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/507e6/5.webp 200w,\n/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/28a80/5.webp 400w,\n/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/b0544/5.webp 600w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/37402/5.jpg 200w,\n/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/4cda9/5.jpg 400w,\n/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/3ad8d/5.jpg 600w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/3ad8d/5.jpg\"\n            alt=\"An example image\"\n            title=\"kutta chutiya\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span>\nWould you like more information on this topic?</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>ðŸ§ª Brass: An Alloy of Copper and Zinc ðŸ§ª</h1>\n<p>Brass, often seen in door knobs, jars, and decorative materials, is not an element but an alloy. It's a mixture of copper and zinc, both elemental metals with their own properties. When mixed, they create new 'flavours' of metals, much like mixing spices in a bowl.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, creating a new 'flavour' of metal.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>ðŸ”¬ The Science Behind Brass ðŸ”¬</h2>\n<p>Copper atoms are quite large and are arranged in a neat sequence, like rows of trolley cars. This neat arrangement allows copper to be ductile, meaning it can smoothly change shape under pressure. This property makes copper ideal for making wires for electricity transmission cables.</p>\n<p>Zinc atoms, on the other hand, are slightly larger than copper atoms. When mixed with copper, zinc atoms act like misshapen trolley cars, obstructing the flow of copper atoms. This obstruction makes the alloy stronger and less likely to bend easily under pressure.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The addition of zinc to copper creates an alloy that is stronger and less likely to deform under pressure.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>ðŸ¥„ The Usefulness of Brass ðŸ¥„</h2>\n<p>Brass is used for many things, not just copper. The addition of zinc makes it stronger and less likely to bend easily under pressure. This makes brass ideal for making utensils or durable objects like door knobs, which undergo a lot of rough handling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Brass is a durable material ideal for making utensils and objects that undergo a lot of rough handling.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>ðŸ’¡ The Beauty of Alloys ðŸ’¡</h2>\n<p>Alloys, like brass, are beautiful in their own way. They are created by mixing different elements to create a new material with unique properties. So, the next time you see brass, remember the beauty of alloys and the simple yellow metal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Alloys, like brass, are a testament to the beauty of mixing different elements to create a new material with unique properties.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Remember, while pure gold is often quite soft and can deform easily under pressure, brass is a good survivor. It's a testament to the beauty of alloys and the simple yellow metal.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"aws","author":"Author Name","time":"25/02/2017","summary":"This is a summary of the blog post...abc def gfhy iiii olol olkmn lokjmm kijuyhgtr nhbngvfdc ","article":"Free","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/8dc98/5.jpg","srcSet":"/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/16947/5.jpg 150w,\n/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/460bb/5.jpg 300w,\n/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/8dc98/5.jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/9285b/5.webp 150w,\n/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/b979a/5.webp 300w,\n/static/bbfc14f24e3cbb573dc9a57ec4a5d95d/2fa07/5.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":400}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/art/machine learning/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
